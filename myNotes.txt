This is the simple ionic app, I have some comments:-
#1) The photos on endpoint (​ https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos​ ) has 5000 results, I tried to let the user
    load them all at first and this takes longer specially for slow internet connection. So, I let the app load 10 photos
    per request, which improve the user experience little bit.


#2) On the endpoint there is no relations between photos and comments. Each comments belongs to (posts). I assumed the
    "post id" equals to "photo id" to let the application run.

#3) I run out of the time, and I did not focus on code comments and I did not refactor some codes.

#4)
